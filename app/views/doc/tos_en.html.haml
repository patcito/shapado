  **Wording**

  By posts we mean questions, answers and comments.

  **The gist**

  We (the folks at [Ricodigo.com](http://ricodigo.com)) run a service called [Shapado.com](http://shapado.com) and would love for you to use it. Our service is designed to give you as much control and ownership over what goes in your groups and posts as possible and encourage you to express yourself freely. However, be responsible in what you post. In particular, make sure that none of the prohibited items listed below appear in your groups and posts or get linked to from your posts (things like spam, viruses, or hate content).

  You can review our [Public Group](http://shapado.com) to get a sense of the types of posts that are welcome on our service (or not!). If you find a Shapado account that you believe violates our terms of service, please check our [Contact](http://shapado.com/contact) documentation.

  (Note: Automattic, Inc., original creators of the below Terms of Service, decided to make them available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means you’re more than welcome to steal it and repurpose it for your own use. Just make sure to replace references to us with ones to you. They’d appreciate a link to [WordPress.com](http://www.wordPress.com) somewhere on your site. They spent a lot of money and time on the below, and other people shouldn’t need to do the same. (We didn't!))

You must immediately notify Operator of any unauthorized uses of your posts, your groups, your account or any other breaches of security. Operator will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

      * the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;

      * the Content is not spam, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);
